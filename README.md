# NAME: AutoEquip
# VERSION: 1.0.0 
# GITHUB: https://github.com/mtp1032/AutoEquip

# DESCRIPTION:
A simple addon that automatically equips a player-specified armor set whenever entering or leaving resting zone.
A resting zone is any area in which a player's character accumulates rest XP, such as an inn, a town, or major
city.

To use this addon, a player defines an armor set containing one or more heirloom items and then passes the name
of that armor set to the AutoEquip addon via its minimap button.
