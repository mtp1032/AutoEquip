# NAME: AutoEquip
# VERSION: 1.0.0 
# GITHUB: https://github.com/mtp1032/AutoEquip
# DESCRIPTION:
AutoEquip will automatically equip a previously specified armor set when entering or leaving a rest area (e.g., an inn). For example, suppose a character has two armor sets, one for questing called "DPS," and another consisting of Heirloom items called "LOOMS." When the character enters the Goldshire Inn (a resting area), the addon equips the "LOOMS" set and saves the DPS set. When the character leaves the Inn, the "DPS" set is [re]equipped.
# CONFIGURATION
Click the bag minimap icon and enter the name of your [Heirloom] armor set in the edit box, then press return. If you're already wearing the [Heirloom] set, Autoequip will "restore" the [Heirloom] set when you leave the rest area. If this happens, you can manually equip the desired set (e.g., the DPS set). AutoEquip will remember to restore the DPS set in the future.
# EXPANSIONS
Only Retail and Wrath expansions are supported. Classic Vanilla does not have Heirlooms.
