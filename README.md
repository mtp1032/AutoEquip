# NAME: AutoEquip
# VERSION: 1.0.0 
# GITHUB: https://github.com/mtp1032/AutoEquip

# PURPOSE:
Eliminate the need to manually equip a rest XP set (e.g., containing Heirloom items) when entering a rest area. When leaving the rest area, AutoEquip will restore the armor set the character was previously wearing. In other words, when entering a rest area, AutoEquip saves the player's current armor set and equips the rest XP set. When leaving the rest area, AutoEquip equips/restores the previously save armor set.
# DESCRIPTION:
AutoEquip will automatically equip a previously specified armor set when entering or leaving a rest area (e.g., an inn). For example, suppose a character has two armor sets, one for questing called "DPS," and another consisting of Heirloom items called "LOOMS." When the character enters the Goldshire Inn (a resting area), the addon equips the "LOOMS" set and saves the DPS set for re-equipping when the player leaves the rest area. In other words, when the player's character leaves the rest area, the "DPS" set is [re]equipped.
# CONFIGURATION
When configuring AutoEquip for the first time:
1. If not already equipped, equip your "DPS" set.
2. Click the AutoEquip minimap icon (a small bag) to display AutoEquip's Options Menu.
3. Click the icon of the armor set to be equipped when entering a rest area.

NOTE 1: Heirloom sets will often be your most potent DPS or Healing set (especially at lower levels) so that, in some configurations the "resting" set and the "DPS" set will be identical.

NOTE: 2: If for any reason the addon loads the wrong armor set when leaving or entering a rest area, the do the following:
1. Move outside the rest area and equip your "DPS" set.
2. Click the minimap icon to display the options menu and click on the rest xp set.

# EXPANSIONS
Only Retail and Wrath expansions are supported. Classic Vanilla does not have Heirlooms.
