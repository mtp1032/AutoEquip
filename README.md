# NAME: AutoEquip
# VERSION: 1.0.0 
# GITHUB: https://github.com/mtp1032/AutoEquip
# DESCRIPTION:
AutoEquip will automatically equip a previously specified armor set when entering or leaving a rest area (e.g., an inn). For example, suppose a character has two armor sets, one for questing called "DPS," and another consisting of Heirloom items called "LOOMS." When the character enters the Goldshire Inn (a resting area), the addon equips the "LOOMS" set and saves the DPS set for re-equipping when the player leaves the rest area. In other words, when the player's character leaves the rest area, the "DPS" set is [re]equipped.
# CONFIGURATION
AutoEquip "remembers" the set your character was wearing when you entered a rest area. When you leave the rest area, AutoEquip "remembers" and reequips the previous set. Here's how that behavior is configured:
1. If not already equipped, equip your "DPS" set.
2. Click the AutoEquip minimap icon (a small bag) to display the AutoEquip menu.
3. Click the icon of the armor set to be equipped when entering a rest area.

NOTE: Heirloom sets will often be your most potent DPS or Healing set so that, in some configurations the "resting" set and the "DPS" set will be identical.

# EXPANSIONS
Only Retail and Wrath expansions are supported. Classic Vanilla does not have Heirlooms.
